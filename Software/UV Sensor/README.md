# CAST Software - UV Sensor

This contains all the software used on our Capstone Team's UV Sensor. When the UV lights reaches a certain threshold on the sensor, the Ardiuno will flash a green light. In the scenario where the UV lights has not reached the threshold, the Ardiuno will flash red.

## Data to Support values used in Code

Below shows two different documentations that provide the evidence for data used in the code.

[Gidari-2021-Sars-cov--survival-on-surfaces-and-.pdf](https://github.com/CAST2022/CAST/files/8485068/Gidari-2021-Sars-cov--survival-on-surfaces-and-.pdf)

The document above states "Based on our results, a smaller dose of UV-C (10.25â€“23.71 mJ/cm2) is enough to reduce the viral titer of >99.99%." Meaning 23.71 mJ/cm2 would cover every type of surface covid may appear on. 
If a user knows the specific type of surface the sensor will be placed on, the value can be changed to reflect that type of surface.

The specifications sheet above shows the conversions needed to get the input converted to UV intensity.

## Sensor Data

The following file shows the UV sensor data from a panel of 5 UV-C LEDs in the 265 nm range.
